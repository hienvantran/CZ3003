# CZ3003 - Math Runner

## Project Overview

The application is an educational game that aims to teach students mathematical concepts. Math Runner is meant to be used as a supplementary tool for teaching and learning of mathematics and not as a substitute for in-class lessons by a trained mathematics educator.

Math Runner will be split into several different worlds, each representing different kinds of mathematical concepts. There are 4 worlds in total: Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. Within each world, there will be several levels, each of which represents topics from that concept category, which can range from basic to advanced topics.

There will be two modes of gameplay: single player mode and custom gameplay mode. Single player mode is where a user plays by themself. Custom gameplay is for any student user to issue challenges to other student users. Teacher users can use this mode to assign assignments to students.
